mlcolvar: Machine Learning Collective Variables
===============================================

`mlcolvar`, short for Machine Learning COLlective VARiables, is a Python library aimed to help design data-driven CVs for enhanced sampling simulations. 
The guiding principles of `mlcolvar` are twofold:

1. A unified framework to help test and utilize (some of) the CVs proposed in the literature. 
2. A modular interface that simplifies the development of new approaches and the contamination between them.
