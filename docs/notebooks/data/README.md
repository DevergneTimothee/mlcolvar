This repository contains simulations data for 2D toy models which are used in the tutorials. 

- `muller-brown` --> Muller-Brown potential
- `muller-brown-3states` --> Modified Muller-Brown potential to have 3 metastable states

Each directory contains a notebook `run-md-plumed.ipynb` which has been used to run Langevin dynamics using PLUMED.
Both unbiased and biased simulations have been performed to provide a comprehensive set of simulation data.
